## 2. Overview

### 2.1. Introduction

Colonoscopy is an effective technique for detecting colorectal polyps, which are highly related to colorectal cancer. 
In clinical practice, segmenting polyps from colonoscopy images is of great importance since it provides valuable 
information for diagnosis and surgery. However, accurate polyp segmentation is a challenging task, for two major reasons:
(i) the same type of polyps has a diversity of size, color and texture; and
(ii) the boundary between a polyp and its surrounding mucosa is not sharp. 

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel reverse attention network (PraNet) for accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy
images. Specifically, we first aggregate the features in high-level layers using a parallel partial decoder (PPD). 
Based on the combined feature, we then generate a global map as the initial guidance area for the following components. 
In addition, we mine the boundary cues using a reverse attention (RA) module, which is able to establish the relationship between
areas and boundary cues. Thanks to the recurrent cooperation mechanism between areas and boundaries, 
our PraNet is capable of calibrating any misaligned predictions, improving the segmentation accuracy. 

Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on five challenging datasets across six
metrics show that our PraNet improves the segmentation accuracy significantly, and presents a number of advantages in terms of generalizability,
and real-time segmentation efficiency (∼50fps).

## 3. Proposed Baseline

### 3.1. Training/Testing

The training and testing experiments are conducted using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) with 
a single GeForce RTX TITAN GPU of 24 GB Memory.

> Note that our model also supports low memory GPU, which means you can lower the batch size


1. Configuring your environment (Prerequisites):
   
    Note that PraNet is only tested on Ubuntu OS with the following environments. 
    It may work on other operating systems as well but we do not guarantee that it will.

    + Just enjoy it!

1. Testing Configuration:

    + After you download all the pre-trained model and testing dataset, just run `MyTest.py` to generate the final prediction map: 
    replace your trained model directory (`--pth_path`).
    
    + Just enjoy it!

### 3.2 Evaluating your trained model:

Matlab: One-key evaluation is written in MATLAB code ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_h4_CjD5GKEf7B1MRuzye97H0MXf2GE9/view?usp=sharing)), 
please follow this the instructions in `./eval/main.m` and just run it to generate the evaluation results in `./res/`.
